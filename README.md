Quick tool to organize downloaded conics

This is a quick and dirty c# tool I created so that after I download comic files, I can dump them to a folder and 
when I run this script, it parses out the file name and tries to copy them to some type of structure.
I'm sure there are a billion better ways to accomplish this and I welcome any suggestions or changes.
